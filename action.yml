inputs:
  # vcpkg must be already checked out. Two options:
  # 1. Highly suggested: use vcpkg as submodule of your repository, for example under <repo-root>/vcpkg/.
  #   - uses: lukka/get-vcpkg
  #     # This is useless as it is the default, but shown here anyway:
  #     with:
  #       ${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg
  # 2. Another option is to checkout it prior this action, e.g.,:  
  #   - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  #     with:
  #       repository: myname/myvcpkg
  #       path: vcpkg
